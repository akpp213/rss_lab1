You are not wrong, who deem
I stand amid the roar
Yet if hope has flown away
Through my fingers to the deep,
Is all that we see or seem
Thus much let me avow--
In a vision, or in none,
All that we see or seem
And I hold within my hand
And I hold within my hand
But a dream within a dream?While I weep--while I weep!
That my days have been a dream;

But a dream within a dream?Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?Is but a dream within a dream.
How few! yet how they creep
But a dream within a dream?Is it therefore the less gone?
Is but a dream within a dream.

While I weep--while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
Is all that we see or seem
Grains of the golden sand--
Them with a tighter clasp?
And I hold within my hand

Take this kiss upon the brow!
O God! can I not save
Is but a dream within a dream.
In a vision, or in none,
In a night, or in a day,
Them with a tighter clasp?
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Them with a tighter clasp?
You are not wrong, who deem
In a vision, or in none,
O God! can I not save
Grains of the golden sand--
I stand amid the roar
Grains of the golden sand--
