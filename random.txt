Yet if hope has flown away
In a vision, or in none,
Is all that we see or seem
While I weep--while I weep!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow--
Them with a tighter clasp?
Is it therefore the less gone?
In a vision, or in none,
That my days have been a dream;
O God! can I not save
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Of a surf-tormented shore,
In a vision, or in none,
