In a vision, or in none,
Thus much let me avow--
Is but a dream within a dream.
How few! yet how they creep
One from the pitiless wave?
And, in parting from you now,
Through my fingers to the deep,
In a vision, or in none,
Take this kiss upon the brow!
I stand amid the roar
Thus much let me avow--
Through my fingers to the deep,
Thus much let me avow--
Thus much let me avow--
Is all that we see or seem
I stand amid the roar
Them with a tighter clasp?
Is it therefore the less gone?
I stand amid the roar

All that we see or seem
One from the pitiless wave?
While I weep--while I weep!
